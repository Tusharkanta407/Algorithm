## 📝 Example: A* Algorithm (Documentation Style)

- **Problem**: Find the shortest path in a graph considering both distance and heuristic.  
- **Idea**: A* uses the formula:  
  ```
  f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
  ```
  where:  
  - `g(n)` = cost so far  
  - `h(n)` = heuristic estimate  
- **Applications**: GPS navigation, game AI, robotics path planning.
